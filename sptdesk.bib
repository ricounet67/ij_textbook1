  abstract = {The analysis of instantaneous and average rolling leukocyte velocity
	is crucial to the study of inflammatory disease. In order to record
	features associated with leukocyte rolling, the leukocyte position
	must be tracked, typically by manual observation. Automated tracking
	of leukocytes is possible for in vitro studies, but not for recordings
	resulting from intravital experiments. Therefore, we have designed
	and implemented an image processing system for automated tracking
	of rolling leukocytes in vivo. The novel image processing techniques
	used in the tracking system successfully address the four major problems
	associated with tracking cells in vivo: background movement, severe
	image noise and clutter, cell deformation and contrast change, and
	occlusion of the target cell by other structures. We have tested
	the system in two experimental protocols in which leukocyte rolling
	is observed in venules of the mouse cremaster muscle with and without
	TNF-alpha treatment. The automated tracking system was validated
	by comparing automatically generated displacement and velocity data
	with data from the same recordings collected manually. The root mean
	squared error between the computed displacements and the manually
	measured displacements was less than 12% of the average displacement
	in TNF-alpha-treated venules. The average velocity error was also
	less than 12%. For untreated venules, the computed and measured displacements
	and velocities had an RMSE of less than 8%. The automated tracking
	system allows one, for the first time, to reliably track rolling
	leukocytes in vivo, thus eliminating possible investigator bias and
	increasing throughput.},

	are taken in a straight tube to evaluate the effectiveness of mixing
	in achieving conditions as required by ANSI N13.1-1999 for single
	point extractive sampling from stacks and ducts of nuclear facilities.
	Mixing is evaluated for inlet turbulent intensities of 1.5%, 10%,
	and 20%, achieved by introducing various bi-plane grids, and for
	conditions generated by a commercial static gas mixer. The data obtained
	(at Reynolds number = 15,000) highlight the importance of inlet turbulence
	intensity in the process of turbulent dispersion of a dilute gas.
	The gas mixer does not introduce significant pressure losses and
	unlike bi-plane grids, the turbulence downstream of the mixer is
	not homogenous. A judicious choice of the release location that uses
	the large scale eddies and inhomogeneity of the turbulence ensures
	that the specified ANSI N13.1-1999 criteria are attained within 7
	diameters downstream of the duct inlet. This is significantly more
	effective than a bi-plane grid where even with 20% inlet intensity
	the criteria are met only at 21 diameters downstream. The predictions
	of a proposed semi-empirical correlation match favorably with data.
	For example, at 18 diameters downstream with inlet intensities of
	1.5% and 10%, the predicted coefficients of variation (COVs) of 150%
	and 65% are close to the actual values of 154% and 50%; where the
	COV of a set of measurements is the ratio of the standard deviation
	of the set to its mean value. The corresponding results obtained
	using commercially available software are 141% and 12%. Results from
	a particle-tracking model show good qualitative trends, but they
	should not be used to determine compliance with the requirements
	of the ANSI standard.},

	camera, has been developed for tracking receptors on the surfaces
	of living cells. The technique is applicable to receptors for particles
	such as lipoproteins and viruses that can be labeled with a few tens
	of fluorophores. The positions of single particles in each image
	are determined to within 25 nm by fitting the fluorescence distribution
	to a two-dimensional Gaussian function. This procedure also provides
	an accurate measure of intensity, which is used as a tag for automated
	tracking of particles from frame to frame. The method is applied
	to an investigation of the mobility of receptors for LDL and influenza
	virus particles on human dermal fibroblasts at 4 degrees C. In contrast
	to previous studies by FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching),
	it is found that receptors have a low but measurable mobility at
	4 degrees C. Analysis of individual particle tracks indicates that
	whilst some receptors undergo random diffusion, others undergo directed
	motion (flow) or diffusion restricted to a domain. A procedure is
	proposed for subdividing receptors according to their different types
	of motion and hence determining their motional parameters. The finding

	uses multiple thresholding to segment individual cells at a starting
	timepoint, and then iteratively applies a template-matching algorithm
	to locate a particular cell's position at subsequent timepoints.
	To speed up the method, we have developed a distributed implementation
	in which template matching is carried out in parallel on several
	different server machines. The distributed implementation showed
	a monotonic decrease in response time with increasing number of servers
	(up to 15 tested), demonstrating that the tracking algorithm is well
	suited to parallelization, and that nearly real-time performance
	could be expected on a parallel processor. Of four different template
	matching statistics tested for 3-D tracking of amoebae from the cellular
	slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum, we found that the automated
	procedure performed best when using a correlation statistic for matching.
	Using this statistic, the method achieved a 98.5% success rate in
	correctly identifying a cell from one time point to the next. This

	microtubules. Here we provide evidence that within cells phagosomes
	display two different kinds of microtubule-based movements in approximately
	equal proportions. The first type occurs predominantly in the cell
	periphery, often shortly after the phagosome is formed, and at speeds
	below 0.1 microm/second. The second is faster (0.2-1.5 micron/second)
	and occurs mainly after phagosomes have reached the cell interior.
	Treating cells with nanomolar concentrations of taxol or nocodazole
	alters microtubule dynamics without affecting either total polymer
	mass or microtubule organisation. Such treatments slow the accumulation
	of phagosomes in the perinuclear region and reduce the number of
	slow movements by up to 50% without affecting the frequency of fast
	movements. This suggests that a proportion of slow movements are
	mediated by microtubule dynamics while fast movements are powered
	by microtubule motors. In macrophages, interphase microtubules radiate
	from the microtubule organising centre with their plus-end towards
	the cell periphery. To understand the behaviour of 'early' phagosomes
	at the cell periphery we investigated their ability to bind microtubule
	plus-ends in vitro. We show that early phagosomes have a strong preference
	for microtubule plus-ends, whereas 'late' phagosomes do not, and
	that plus-end affinity requires the presence of microtubule-associated
	proteins within cytosol. We suggest that phagosomes can bind to the
	plus-ends of dynamic microtubules and move by following their shrinkage
	or growth.},

	of receptor endo- and exocytosis has been shown to be involved in

	motility, and in regulating numerous cellular processes. Observations
	suggest that the functioning of focal adhesions is possible due to
	their dynamic nature, yet the mechanisms that govern their motion
	are not well understood. This study addresses the process of focal
	adhesion remodeling using two distinct theoretical approaches. Namely,
	adhesion sites are modeled as clusters of integrins that are either
	bound to cytoskeletal elements or dissociated and temporarily free
	of any attachments. In the first approach effects of cluster size
	and permeability on the diffusion of mobile adhesion structures are
	studied using Brinkman's effective medium approach. Diffusion coefficients
	calculated by this hydrodynamic model significantly decrease with
	the increase in contact area (the effective size of the focal adhesion).
	In the second approach focal adhesions are modeled as clusters of
	transmembrane proteins tightly connected to the cytoskeleton, but
	still capable of motion. The remodeling of these clusters is coupled
	to the deformation of the cytoskeleton by means of equating energies
	at the end states of a reversible elastodynamic interaction. Due
	to large uncertainty of the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton
	properties, predicted diffusion coefficients vary within several
	orders of magnitude. However, a reasonable set of parameters for
	each model yields diffusion coefficients that compare favorably with
	those measured by single-particle tracking (SPT), fluorescence recovery
	after photobleaching (FRAP), and fluorescence digital imaging (FDI).
	The estimated Young's modulus of the stress fibers is also in good
	agreement with measurements. To assess the relevance of the models
	to focal adhesion remodeling and to improve their predictions, further
	data on the morphology of focal adhesions and on properties of the

  abstract = {Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are proteins that reversibly
	bind to and regulate microtubule dynamics and functions in vivo.
	We examined the dynamics of binding of a MAP called ensconsin (E-MAP-115)
	to microtubules in vivo. We used 5xGFP-EMTB, a construct in which
	the microtubule-binding domain of ensconsin (EMTB) is fused to five
	copies of green fluorescent protein (GFP), as a reporter molecule
	amenable to the use of fluorescent speckle microscopy. Fluorescent
	speckle microscopy (FSM) sequences and kymograph analyses showed
	rapid dynamics of speckles comprised of 5xGFP-EMTB in untreated cells.
	By contrast, in detergent-lysed cytoskeletons, speckles were not
	dynamic. Since detergent-lysed cytoskeletons differ from living cells
	in that they lack both ATP and dynamic microtubules, we used azide
	treatment to substantially reduce the level of ATP in living cells
	and we used Taxol to halt microtubule dynamics. Both treatments slowed
	the dynamics of 5xGFP-EMTB speckles observed by FSM. We also used
	fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to quantify the
	half-time of binding and dissociation of the 5xGFP-EMTB chimera and
	to compare this half-time to that of the full-length MAP molecule.
	In untreated cells, the t(g) of either 5xGFP-EMTB or full-length
	GFP-ensconsin was similarly rapid (approximately 4 seconds), while
	in ATP-reduced and Taxol-treated cells, t(g) was increased to 210
	seconds and 40 seconds, respectively. In detergent-extracted cells
	no recovery was seen. Consistent with the rapid dynamics of 5xGFP-EMTB
	measured with fluorescent speckle microscopy and FRAP, we estimated
	that the affinity of the MAP for microtubules is approximately 40
	microM in untreated living cells, compared with approximately 1 microM
	in vitro. However, K(D,app) was not significantly changed in the
	presence of azide and was increased to 110 microM in the presence
	of Taxol. To test whether changes in the phosphorylation state of
	cellular proteins might be responsible for altering the dynamics
	of ensconsin binding, we used FSM to monitor staurosporine-treated
	cells. Staurosporine treatment substantially halted dynamics of 5xGFP-EMTB
	speckles along MTs. Our results show that ensconsin is highly dynamic
	in its association with microtubules, and its microtubule association
	can be altered by in vivo phosphorylation events.},

  abstract = {The extreme length of axonal processes requires that aerobic ATP production
	and Ca(2+) homeostasis are non-uniformly organized in the cytoplasm.
	As a result, the transport and positioning of mitochondria along
	axons is essential for neuronal homeostasis. Mitochondria undergo
	rapid but intermittent transport in both the anterograde and retrograde
	directions in axons. We have shown that in chick embryonic sensory
	neurons, the transport of mitochondria responds to physiological
	changes in the cell and, particularly, to growth cone activity. When
	an axon is actively elongating, mitochondria move preferentially
	anterograde and then become stationary, accumulating in the region
	of the active growth cone. When axonal elongation ceases, mitochondria
	in the distal axon resume movement but undergo net retrograde transport
	and become uniformly distributed along the axon. This redistribution
	of mitochondria is achieved in two ways: there is a transition between
	motile and stationary mitochondria and a large up- and downregulation
	of their anterograde, but not retrograde, motor activity. Mitochondrial
	transport does not respond to the experimentally induced elongation
	of axons in the absence of an active growth cone, implying that signals
	from the active growth cone regulate transport. To determine the
	nature of these signals, we have focally stimulated the shafts of
	sensory axons in culture with nerve growth factor (NGF) covalently
	conjugated to polystyrene beads. We find that mitochondria accumulate
	at regions of focal NGF stimulation. This response is specific to
	mitochondria and does not result from general disruption of the cytoskeleton
	in the region of stimulation. Disruption of the phosphoinositide
	3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway, one of the signaling pathways downstream
	from NGF-receptor binding, completely eliminates NGF effects on mitochondrial
	behavior in axons. We propose that mitochondrial transport and/or
	docking are regulated in part via NGF/TrkA/PI 3-kinase signaling.},

	ranging from the diffusion of proteins in cell membranes to the movement
	of molecular motors. A plethora of computer algorithms have been
	developed to monitor the sub-pixel displacement of fluorescent objects
	between successive video frames, and some have been claimed to have
	"nanometer" resolution. To date, there has been no rigorous comparison
	of these algorithms under realistic conditions. In this paper, we
	quantitatively compare specific implementations of four commonly
	used tracking algorithms: cross-correlation, sum-absolute difference,
	centroid, and direct Gaussian fit. Images of fluorescent objects
	ranging in size from point sources to 5 microm were computer generated
	with known sub-pixel displacements. Realistic noise was added and
	the above four algorithms were compared for accuracy and precision.
	We found that cross-correlation is the most accurate algorithm for
	large particles. However, for point sources, direct Gaussian fit
	to the intensity distribution is the superior algorithm in terms
	of both accuracy and precision, and is the most robust at low signal-to-noise.
	Most significantly, all four algorithms fail as the signal-to-noise

	stability. In living organisms, use of a hierarchy of tensegrity
	networks both optimizes structural efficiency and provides a mechanism
	to mechanically couple the parts with the whole: mechanical stresses
	applied at the macroscale result in structural rearrangements at
	the cell and molecular level. CONCLUSION: Due to use of tensegrity
	architecture, mechanical stress is concentrated and focused on signal
	transducing molecules that physically associate with cell surface
	molecules that anchor cells to extracellular matrix, such as integrins,
	and with load-bearing elements within the internal cytoskeleton and
	nucleus. Mechanochemical transduction may then proceed through local
	stress-dependent changes in molecular mechanics, thermodynamics,
	and kinetics within the cell. In this manner, the entire cellular
	response to stress may be orchestrated and tuned by altering the
	prestress in the cell, just as changing muscular tone can alter mechanical
	stability and structural coordination throughout the whole musculoskeletal
	system.},

	separated by nonadhesive regions such that the pattern of islands

  abstract = {Mechanical forces play an important role in the organization, growth,

	many of the biological responses to external forces originate at
	two types of specialized microscale structures: focal adhesions that
	link cells to their surrounding extracellular matrix and adherens
	junctions that link adjacent cells. Transmission of forces from outside
	the cell through cell-matrix and cell-cell contacts appears to control
	the maturation or disassembly of these adhesions and initiates intracellular

	the localized concentration of these cytoskeletal tensions at adhesions
	is also a major mediator of mechanical signaling. This review summarizes
	the role of mechanical forces in the formation, stabilization, and

	PLL-g-PEG or proteins combined with a subsequent PLL-g-PEG backfill
	can be applied to a wide variety of substrate materials with negatively

	cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) substrates. When plated onto
	artificial adhesive surfaces, cells first flatten and deform extensively
	as they spread. At the molecular level, the interaction of membrane-based
	integrins with the ECM has been shown to initiate a complex cascade
	of signaling events [1], which subsequently triggers cellular morphological
	changes and results in the generation of contractile forces [2].
	Here, we focus on the early stages of cell spreading and probe their
	dynamics by quantitative visualization and biochemical manipulation
	with a variety of cell types and adhesive surfaces, adhesion receptors,
	and cytoskeleton-altering drugs. We find that the dynamics of adhesion
	follows a universal power-law behavior. This is in sharp contrast
	with the common belief that spreading is regulated by either the

	tubules and globular elements, which translocated in a saltatory

	and VIP36-SP-FP indicated that the globular structures were pre-Golgi
	carriers, and that VIP36-SP-FP segregated from cargo within the Golgi

	contrast microscopy. Initially, the antibody-gold complexes bind
	to receptors which are freely mobile on the upper cell surface; they
	then become trapped at the inner margins of the peripheral lamellae
	and internalize. During endocytosis discrete gold-loaded vesicular
	elements first appear, and then, as they fuse, a heterogenous peripheral
	endosomal compartment forms. The endosomes from this compartment
	then begin to migrate centripetally through the cytoplasm in a saltatory
	way so that within 15 min gold label accumulates in a juxtanuclear
	endosome compartment. This compartment, which consists mainly of
	multivesicular bodies, is thus formed by the influx and retention
	of peripheral endosomal elements and their continued fusion in the
	juxtanuclear area. Although their overall migration is inward, saltating
	endosomes frequently reverse their direction of movement. As label
	builds up in the juxtanuclear area, small vesicles containing gold
	label continuously pinch off from the larger elements and migrate
	toward the cell periphery. Experiments with nocodazole and sodium
	azide show that the saltatory movements, the accumulation and retention
	of endosomes in the juxtanuclear area, and the separation of vesicles
	from endosomes are driven by a microtubule-associated, ATP-dependent,
	motility-generating mechanism. Analysis of the movements shows that
	although each individual vesicle saltation can occur unpredictably
	toward the centre or the periphery of the cell, a net centripetal
	flux is observed. Moreover, it is evident that the probability of
	migration toward and maintenance in the juxtanuclear area is related
	to the diameter of the vesicles. We propose a mechanism by which
	bidirectional saltation along microtubules forming a radial network
	may be instrumental in the selective concentration of large endosomes
	in the juxtanuclear area while small vesicles are left free to return
	to the periphery. This process may be responsible for the sorting
	of receptors and ligands destined either for intracellular degradation
	in juxtanuclear lysosomes or, alternatively, for recycling to the

	theoretical models can be tested through their ability to predict
	experimental observations. With the current method we have found
	rigorous mathematical explanations for mechanisms such as sarcomere
	popping, extra tension and homogenization. These phenomena have been
	observed for many years in single fibers experiments, yet have never
	been completely understood in terms of a mechanical model. Now they
	can be explained on a theoretical basis. Interestingly, rather simplistic
	descriptions of each of the various molecular components in the sarcomere
	(actin-myosin cross-bridges, titin and contributions from passive
	elastic components) are sufficient to predict these behaviors. The
	complexity of a real muscle fiber is addressed through rigorous coupling
	of the single component models in a system of differential equations.
	We examine the properties of the differential equations, based on
	a down-stripped model, which permits the derivation of analytical
	solutions. They suggest that the contraction characteristics of inter-connected
	sarcomeres are essentially dictated by the initial distribution of
	the sarcomeres on the force-length curve and their starting velocities.
	The complete model is applied to show the complexity of inter-sarcomere
	dynamics of activated fibers in stretch-release experiments with
	either external force or length control. Seemingly contradictory
	and unexpected observations from single fiber experiments, which
	have hitherto been discussed with the argument of uncontrollable
	biological variability, turn out to be a consistent set of possible
	fiber responses. They result from a convolution of multiple relatively

	It is based on an active contour method for cell-edge detection,
	which allows tracking of changes in cell shape and position. Fluorescence
	intensities at specific cortical subregions can be followed in space
	and time and correlated with cell motility. The translocation of
	two GFP tagged proteins (CRAC and GRP1) from the cytosol to the membrane
	in response to stimulation with the chemoattractant cAMP during chemotaxis
	of Dictyostelium cells and studies of the spatio-temporal dynamics

	differences in the rate of association and dissociation from the
	membrane can be observed for the two PH domain containing proteins.
	The analysis of periodic CRAC translocation to the leading edge of
	a cell responding to natural cAMP waves in a mound demonstrates the
	power of this approach. It is not only capable of tracking the outline
	of cells within aggregates in front of a noisy background, but furthermore
	allows the construction of spatio-temporal polar plots, capturing
	the dynamics of the protein distribution at the cell membrane within

	important functions. First, it gives a concise and accurate description
	of the motile process and can detect subtle differences in motility
	due to different genetic makeup or experimental conditions. Second,
	its objectivity means that results can be communicated precisely
	and used unambiguously to test hypotheses about motility. Third,
	it may be used to derive a mathematical model with the same statistical
	properties as the motile process and thus elucidate the mechanism
	of motility. In this paper, we introduce a general procedure for
	analysing cell motility in a wide variety of circumstances. We describe
	a pilot project for the analysis of simple geometrical data obtained
	from randomly moving fibroblasts. Finally, as an example, we show

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We present the synthesis, characterization and initial
	structure-function analysis of a new class of bioactive agent that
	allows the application of techniques from colloid science to biological
	surfaces. Stable colloidal suspensions can be generated by immobilizing
	a dense brush of soluble polymer at the colloidal surface, creating
	a zone protected against the adhesion of approaching particles, a
	phenomenon termed polymeric steric stabilization. This is often accomplished
	for aqueous colloidal dispersions using adsorbing block copolymers.
	We demonstrate that water-soluble block copolymers can be designed
	to adsorb onto heterogeneous biological surfaces and block cell-cell
	and cell-surface adhesion, using polymer compositions and architectures
	that are quite different from surfactants used for stabilizing nonbiological
	colloidal dispersions. RESULTS: Comb copolymers were synthesized
	having polycationic backbones (poly-L-lysine, PLL), serving as the
	anchor for binding to the net negatively charged biological surfaces,
	grafted with water-soluble polynonionic chains (polyethylene glycol,
	PEG), to block biological recognition, producing PLL-graft-PEG copolymers.
	Specific copolymers were found to sterically stabilize red blood
	cells from lectin-induced hemagglutination and fibroblasts from adhesion
	to fibronectin-coated surfaces. The polymer design principles, which
	appear to be unique for adsorption to heterogeneous biological surfaces,
	require the use of very high molecular weight comb copolymers, perhaps
	because anionic sites are non-uniformly distributed on biological
	surfaces, and the ability of larger copolymers to span between highly
	anionic sites. CONCLUSIONS: Water-soluble copolymers were produced
	that can block recognition at biological surfaces, on the basis of
	nonspecific physicochemical phenomena rather than specific biochemical
	interactions.},

	cells, suggesting a tight binding to heterochromatin and/or lamins.
	A subpopulation of LBR-GFP within ER membranes, by contrast, was

	membrane system in prometaphase, exhibiting the same high mobility
	and diffusion constant as observed in interphase ER membranes. LBR-GFP
	rapidly diffused across the cell within the membrane network defined
	by the ER, suggesting the integrity of the ER was maintained in mitosis,
	with little or no fragmentation and vesiculation. At the end of mitosis,
	nuclear membrane reformation coincided with immobilization of LBR-GFP

	ER membranes then wrapped around chromatin over the course of 2-3

  abstract = {Protein lateral mobility in cell membranes is generally measured using
	fluorescence photobleaching recovery (FPR). Since the development
	of this technique, the data have been interpreted by assuming free
	Brownian diffusion of cell surface receptors in two dimensions, an
	interpretation that requires that a subset of the diffusing species
	remains immobile. The origin of this so-called immobile fraction
	remains a mystery. In FPR, the motions of thousands of particles
	are inherently averaged, inevitably masking the details of individual
	motions. Recently, tracking of individual cell surface receptors
	has identified several distinct types of motion (Gross and Webb,
	1988; Ghosh and Webb, 1988, 1990, 1994; Kusumi et al. 1993; Qian
	et al. 1991; Slattery, 1995), thereby calling into question the classical
	interpretation of FPR data as free Brownian motion of a limited mobile
	fraction. We have measured the motion of fluorescently labeled immunoglobulin
	E complexed to high affinity receptors (Fc epsilon RI) on rat basophilic
	leukemia cells using both single particle tracking and FPR. As in
	previous studies, our tracking results show that individual receptors
	may diffuse freely, or may exhibit restricted, time-dependent (anomalous)
	diffusion. Accordingly, we have analyzed FPR data by a new model
	to take this varied motion into account, and we show that the immobile
	fraction may be due to particles moving with the anomalous subdiffusion
	associated with restricted lateral mobility. Anomalous subdiffusion
	denotes random molecular motion in which the mean square displacements
	grow as a power law in time with a fractional positive exponent less
	than one. These findings call for a new model of cell membrane structure.},

	of nonmagnetic beads taken up by phagocytosis was analyzed by single
	particle tracking, which allowed us to measure the length of straight
	steps and the corresponding velocities of the movements. The motion
	consists of a superposition of nearly straight long-range steps (step
	length in the micrometer range) and local random walks (step widths
	about 0.1 microm). The velocities for the former type of motion range
	from 1 to 3 microm/s. They decrease with increasing bead size and
	are attributed to rapid active transport along microtubuli. The short-range
	local motions exhibit velocities of less than 0.5 microm/s and reflect
	the internal dynamics of the cytoplasm. Viscoelastic response curves
	were measured by application of force pulses with amplitudes varying
	between 50 pN and 400 pN. Analysis of the response curves in terms
	of mechanical equivalent circuits yielded cytoplasmic viscosities
	varying between 10 and 350 Pa s. Simultaneous analysis of the response
	curves and of the bead trajectories showed that the motion of the
	beads is determined by the local yield stress within the cytoplasmic
	scaffold and cisternae, which varies between sigma = 30 Pa and 250
	Pa. The motion of intracellular particles is interpreted in terms
	of viscoplastic behavior and the apparent viscosity is a measure
	of the reciprocal rate of bond breakage within the cytoplasmatic
	network. The viscoelastic moduli are interpreted as dynamic quantities
	which depend sensitively on the amplitude of the forces, and the
	rate of bond breakage is determined by the Arrhenius-Kramers law
	with the activation energy being reduced by the work performed by
	the applied force. In agreement with previous work, we provide evidence
	that the myosin II-deficient cells exhibit higher yield stresses,

  abstract = {The mitotic spindle has long been recognized to play an essential
	role in determining the position of the cleavage furrow during cell
	division, however little is known about the mechanisms involved in
	this process. One attractive hypothesis is that signals from the
	spindle may function to induce reorganization of cortical structures
	and transport of actin filaments to the equator during cytokinesis.
	While an important idea, few experiments have directly tested this
	model. In the present study, we have used a variety of experimental
	approaches to identify microtubule-dependent effects on key cortical
	events during normal cell cleavage, including cortical flow, reorientation
	of actin filaments, and formation of the contractile apparatus. Single-particle
	tracking experiments showed that the microtubule disrupting drug
	nocodazole induces an inhibition of the movements of cell surface
	receptors following anaphase onset, while the microtubule stabilizing
	drug taxol causes profound changes in the overall pattern of receptor
	movements. These effects were accompanied by a related set of changes
	in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. In nocodazole-treated
	cells, the three-dimensional organization of cortical actin filaments
	appeared less ordered than in controls. Measurements with fluorescence-detected
	linear dichroism indicated a decrease in the alignment of filaments
	along the spindle axis. In contrast, actin filaments in taxol-treated
	cells showed an increased alignment along the equator on both the
	ventral and dorsal cortical surfaces, mirroring the redistribution
	pattern of surface receptors. Together, these experiments show that
	spindle microtubules are involved in directing bipolar flow of surface
	receptors and reorganization of actin filaments during cell division,
	thus acting as a stimulus for positioning cortical cytoskeletal components
	and organizing the contractile apparatus of dividing tissue culture
	cells.},

	yet simple cell shape allowing high speed, rapid directional oscillations,
	and low affinity interactions to the substrate that are coupled to
	a low degree of cytoskeletal organization lacking discrete focal
	contacts. At the onset of T cell migration, a default program, here
	described as migration-associated polarization, is initiated, resulting
	in the polar redistribution of cell surface receptors and cytoskeletal
	elements. Polarization involves protein cycling either to the leading

	to a central polarizing compartment (MTOC, PKC, MARCKS), or into

	with the ECM itself. Due to the simple shape and a diffusely organized
	cytoskeleton, the interactions to the surrounding extracellular matrix

	of the cell body and (iii) detachment of the trailing edge. In cells
	of flattened morphology migrating slowly across 2-D substrate, contact-dependent
	clustering of adhesion receptors including integrins results in focal

	energy-liberating chemical reactions to the production of mechanical
	work. A key goal in the study of these systems is to characterize
	at the molecular level mechanical events associated with individual
	reaction steps in the catalytic cycles of single enzyme molecules.
	Ideally, one would like to measure movements driven by single (or
	a few) enzyme molecules with sufficient temporal resolution and spatial
	precision that these events can be directly observed. Kinesin, a
	force-generating ATPase involved in microtubule-based intracellular
	organelle transport, will drive the unidirectional movement of microscopic
	plastic beads along microtubules in vitro. Under certain conditions,
	a few (less than or equal to 10) kinesin molecules may be sufficient
	to drive either bead movement or organelle transport. Here we describe
	a method for determining precise positional information from light-microscope
	images. The method is applied to measure kinesin-driven bead movements
	in vitro with a precision of 1-2 nm. Our measurements reveal basic
	mechanical features of kinesin-driven movements along the microtubule
	lattice, and place significant constraints on possible molecular

	their interaction with the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge
	of growth cones and other motile cells is important for neurite outgrowth
	and cell migration. Receptor delivered to the leading edge binds
	to its ligand, which induces coupling of the receptor to a rearward
	flowing network of actin filaments. This coupling is thought to facilitate
	advance. We show here that a soluble growth factor stimulates this
	cycling. We have used single particle tracking to monitor the effects
	of nerve growth factor (NGF) on the movements of beta1 integrin in
	the plane of the plasma membrane of the filopodia of growth cones.
	Beta1 integrin was visualized by its binding of 0.2 microm beads
	coated with a monoclonal Ab directed against an extracellular epitope
	distant from the binding site for extracellular matrix ligands. The
	beads were observed by video microscopy. Beads coated with a low
	concentration of antibody, and therefore bound to unliganded receptor
	with little cross-linking, showed an increase in both diffusion and
	directed forward transport in response to NGF. Transport had a net
	velocity of 37 microm/minute and was characterized by brief periods
	of sustained forward excursions with a velocity of 75-150 microm/minute.
	There was a 2-fold increase in the number of beads accumulated at
	the tips of filopodia after 10 minutes, indicating that NGF enhanced
	the delivery of beta1 integrin to the periphery. Forward transport
	was dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton and myosin ATPase,
	since treatment with cytochalasin D or the myosin ATPase inhibitor
	butanedione monoxime inhibited the transport but not the diffusion
	of receptors. NGF also greatly increased the steady rearward migration
	of beads coated with a high density of (&bgr;)1 integrin antibody,
	indicating that coupling of cross-linked receptor to the retrograde
	flow of actin is also enhanced. The rate of the retrograde flow of
	actin was unaffected by NGF. These studies show that a soluble factor
	can stimulate the coupling of a receptor for substrate-bound factor
	to two actomyosin-based transport mechanisms and thus facilitate
	the response of the growth cone to the substrate-bound factor by
	increasing cycling of the receptor at the periphery.},

	a coordination hypothesis, but cannot be easily explained with a

	This analysis yields an estimate for the force that a single cytoplasmic

	expected for multiple motors based on in vitro estimates of cytoplasmic
	dynein processivity. Therefore, we propose the existence of a process
	that ends runs before the motors fall off the microtubules. We find
	that this process acts with a constant probability per unit distance,
	and is typically coupled to a switch in travel direction. A process
	with similar properties governs plus end motion, and its regulation

	three-dimensional (3-D) extracellular matrices. We have analyzed
	the migration of murine DC from different tissue origins within 3-D
	collagen lattices through the use of time-lapse videomicroscopy and
	single-cell tracking. Directly after incorporation, 50-90% of DC
	from the spleen (spDC) and Langerhans cells freshly isolated from
	the epidermis (fLC) displayed active motility in these matrices.
	Whereas mature spDC showed multilateral pseudopod dynamics as well
	as fast and heterogeneous migration, immature fLC displayed a spherical
	shape with faint membrane processes and very homogenous, slow migration
	characteristics. In the absence of external stimuli, migration of
	both, spDC and fLC, vanished after >36 h due to cell death. Maintaining
	fLC viability by external granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
	factor or tumor necrosis factor alpha prolonged migration up to 5
	days. During this period fLC transformed into mature cells with large
	dendrites, thereby developing a heterogeneous migration pattern more
	similar to spDC. In randomly polymerized collagen matrices cell paths
	were without preferential orientation. In contrast, in artificially
	aligned lattices directional paths in accordance with the forced
	fiber orientation were observed. Thus, migration is an inherent property
	of DC, largely influenced by tissue origin, degree of maturity, and
	the 3-D structure of the environment.},

	microscopy was used in conjunction with video intensification immunofluorescence

	the number of microtubules making up a linear element with light
	microscopy alone, AVEC-DIC microscopy was used in conjunction with
	whole-mount electron microscopy to show bidirectional transport along
	a single microtubule [Hayden and Allen, 1984]. These studies demonstrate
	that the structural polarity of the microtubule does not determine
	the direction of particle motion, and since dynein is an asymetric

	explain bidirectional transport along a single microtubule. Very

	types. Human embryonic lung fibroblasts grown on glass coverslips

	from the origin. The SIT camera was then used to track FS attached
	to lipids and Thy1 molecules on the surface of fibroblasts. The lateral
	diffusion of lipid-bound FS was unconstrained, and the ensemble averaged
	diffusion coefficient was 0.80 x 10(-9) cm2/sec. Thy1-bound FS existed
	in two mobility populations, both of which demonstrated constrained
	mobility. The rapidly moving population, comprising 61% of the total,
	had an ensemble diffusion coefficient of 6.1 x 10(-10) cm2/sec, and
	appeared to be restricted to domains with a mean length of about
	700 nm. The slowly moving population, comprising about 39% of the
	total, had a diffusion coefficient of 5.7 x 10(-12) cm2/sec. These
	results demonstrate that nanovid can be extended to the realm of
	fluorescence microscopy and support previous studies indicating that
	while the lateral mobilities of at least some lipids are not constrained
	to small domains by barriers to lateral diffusion in the fibroblast
	plasmalemma, a peripheral membrane protein which is bound only by
	a lipid anchor can be prevented from diffusing freely.},

	fused to green fluorescent protein (VSVG-GFP), were used for kinetic
	modeling of protein traffic through the various compartments of the
	secretory pathway. A series of first order rate laws was sufficient
	to accurately describe VSVG-GFP transport, and provided compartment
	residence times and rate constants for transport into and out of
	the Golgi complex and delivery to the plasma membrane. For ER to
	Golgi transport the mean rate constant (i.e., the fraction of VSVG-GFP
	moved per unit of time) was 2.8% per min, for Golgi to plasma membrane
	transport it was 3.0% per min, and for transport from the plasma
	membrane to a degradative site it was 0.25% per min. Because these
	rate constants did not change as the concentration of VSVG-GFP in
	different compartments went from high (early in the experiment) to
	low (late in the experiment), secretory transport machinery was never
	saturated during the experiments. The processes of budding, translocation,
	and fusion of post-Golgi transport intermediates carrying VSVG- GFP
	to the plasma membrane were also analyzed using quantitative imaging
	techniques. Large pleiomorphic tubular structures, rather than small
	vesicles, were found to be the primary vehicles for Golgi to plasma
	membrane transport of VSVG-GFP. These structures budded as entire
	domains from the Golgi complex and underwent dynamic shape changes
	as they moved along microtubule tracks to the cell periphery. They
	carried up to 10,000 VSVG-GFP molecules and had a mean life time
	in COS cells of 3.8 min. In addition, they fused with the plasma
	membrane without intersecting other membrane transport pathways in

	as their metabolic function. Unlike many other classes of organelles,
	mitochondria undergo net movement that is the sum of movements in
	both the anterograde and retrograde directions, and their net velocity
	is strongly influenced by their recruitment between stationary and
	motile states. They recently became the first specific class of organelle
	shown to be capable of moving along either microtubule or F-actin
	tracks in the axon, indicating that they probably use a diversity
	of molecular motors. Although we still know relatively little about
	how the movement of specific classes of axonal organelles is coordinated
	with their function in the neuron, in the case of mitochondria it
	is at least clear that their transport delivers them to regions of
	the neuron where ATP consumption is likely to be high, and disperses
	them when local energy needs change. In addition, although mitochondria
	contain both anterograde and retrograde motor activities, the modulation
	of their motility necessary to achieve these redistributions seems
	to rely largely upon regulation of the anterograde motor activity
	alone. A further element in the regulation of their motility and
	distribution is the apparent "docking" of mitochondria to microtubules
	or neurofilaments, a phenomenon which may serve to stabilize their
	distribution once regulated motility has moved them to appropriate
	sites. This review considers the current state of knowledge in these
	areas with an emphasis on the pattern of regulation of motility and
	how it underlies the role of mitochondria as the aerobic ATP source
	of the neuron.},

	axonal transport of protein and membrane be balanced by their degradation
	and retrograde transport. To address the nature and regulation of
	retrograde transport in cultured sympathetic neurons, I analyzed
	the behavior, composition, and ultrastructure of a class of large,
	phase-dense organelles whose movement has been shown to be influenced
	by axonal growth (Hollenbeck, P. J., and D. Bray. 1987. J. Cell Biol.
	105:2827-2835). In actively elongating axons these organelles underwent
	both anterograde and retrograde movements, giving rise to inefficient
	net retrograde transport. This could be shifted to more efficient,
	higher volume retrograde transport by halting axonal outgrowth, or
	conversely shifted to less efficient retrograde transport with a
	larger anterograde component by increasing the intracellular cyclic
	AMP concentration. When neurons were loaded with Texas red-dextran
	by trituration, autophagy cleared the label from an even distribution
	throughout the neuronal cytosol to a punctate, presumably lysosomal,
	distribution in the cell body within 72 h. During this process, 100%
	of the phase-dense organelles were fluorescent, showing that they
	contained material sequestered from the cytosol and indicating that
	they conveyed this material to the cell body. When 29 examples of
	this class of organelle were identified by light microscopy and then
	relocated using correlative electron microscopy, they had a relatively
	constant ultrastructure consisting of a bilamellar or multilamellar
	boundary membrane and cytoplasmic contents, characteristic of autophagic
	vacuoles. When neurons took up Lucifer yellow, FITC-dextran, or Texas
	red-ovalbumin from the medium via endocytosis at the growth cone,
	100% of the phase-dense organelles became fluorescent, demonstrating
	that they also contain products of endocytosis. Furthermore, pulse-chase
	experiments with fluorescent endocytic tracers confirmed that these
	organelles are formed in the most distal region of the axon and undergo
	net retrograde transport. Quantitative ratiometric imaging with endocytosed
	8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid showed that the mean pH of
	their lumena was 7.05. These results indicate that the endocytic
	and autophagic pathways merge in the distal axon, resulting in a
	class of predegradative organelles that undergo regulated transport
	back to the cell body.},

	Cholesterol is not required for clustering in model membranes but

	fluorescence resonance energy transfer and immunofluorescence microscopy
	have been used to directly visualize lipid rafts in membranes. The

  abstract = {The current focus of medicine on molecular genetics ignores the physical
	basis of disease even though many of the problems that lead to pain
	and morbidity, and bring patients to the doctor's office, result
	from changes in tissue structure or mechanics. The main goal of this
	article is therefore to help integrate mechanics into our understanding
	of the molecular basis of disease. This article first reviews the
	key roles that physical forces, extracellular matrix and cell structure
	play in the control of normal development, as well as in the maintenance
	of tissue form and function. Recent insights into cellular mechanotransduction--the
	molecular mechanism by which cells sense and respond to mechanical
	stress--also are described. Re-evaluation of human pathophysiology
	in this context reveals that a wide range of diseases included within
	virtually all fields of medicine and surgery share a common feature:
	their etiology or clinical presentation results from abnormal mechanotransduction.
	This process may be altered by changes in cell mechanics, variations
	in extracellular matrix structure, or by deregulation of the molecular
	mechanisms by which cells sense mechanical signals and convert them
	into a chemical or electrical response. Molecules that mediate mechanotransduction,
	including extracellular matrix molecules, transmembrane integrin
	receptors, cytoskeletal structures and associated signal transduction
	components, may therefore represent targets for therapeutic intervention
	in a variety of diseases. Insights into the mechanical basis of tissue
	regulation also may lead to development of improved medical devices,
	engineered tissues, and biologically-inspired materials for tissue
	repair and reconstruction.},

	bead, which had been covalently coated with folate, was attached
	to the advancing edge of a Dictyostelium ameba with the aid of an
	optical trap. The bead was transported backward on the cell surface.
	Forty-five percent of the transported beads were internalized. The
	bead motion was analyzed by determining every 33 ms the x-y coordinate
	of the centroid of the phase-contrast image of the bead. The x(t)
	and y(t) traces were smoothed over 1 s and the difference between
	the smoothed (x(t) and y(t)) and the original traces, delta(x) identical
	with x(t) - x(t) and delta(y) identical with y(t) - y(t), were calculated,
	which represented relatively rapid components of the bead motion.
	The plot of delta(2) = (delta(x)(2) + delta(y)(2)) against time could
	be divided into three phases on the basis of the variance of delta(2).
	Comparison of the plot with the video sequence indicated that the
	first phase corresponded to the transport, the second phase to the
	internalization, and the third phase to the postinternalization process
	(intracellular movement). Cytochalasin A at 5 microM completely inhibited
	phagocytosis without affecting the binding of bead to the cell surface,
	indicating the importance of actin cytoskeleton in all the phases.
	At 1 microM cytochalasin A the variance of the postinternalization
	process decreased, and the duration of the transport phase increased.
	At 0.25 microM cytochalasin A the duration of the internalization
	phase exhibited a significant increase, but other parameters did
	not change appreciably. The complex and differential effects of cytochalasin
	A on the parameters characterizing the three phases in the phagocytic
	process indicate that various aspects of actin dynamics are involved
	in the individual process of phagocytosis.},

	implicated in cell adhesion by binding to MacMARCKS (Macrophage-enriched
	myristoylated alanine-rice C kinase substrate). However, how dynamitin
	is involved in cell adhesion is unclear despite the fact that both
	MacMARCKS and microtubules regulate beta(2) integrin activation.
	We report that dynamitin regulates beta(2) integrin avidity toward
	iC3b by modulating the lateral mobility of beta(2) integrin molecules.
	Using the single particle tracking method, we found that integrin
	molecular mobility in cells expressing the fusion protein CFP (cyan
	fluorescent protein)-dynamitin or CFP-MB (the MacMARCKS binding domain
	peptide of dynamitin) increased 6-fold over the control cells, suggesting
	that disturbing dynamitin function dramatically altered the cytoskeletal
	constraint on beta(2) integrin molecules. Further mechanistic studies
	revealed that overexpression of dynamitin stimulated the phosphorylation
	of endogenous MacMARCKS protein, which lead to the enhanced tyrosine
	phosphorylation of paxillin. This effect of dynamitin correlates
	with the observation that higher concentration of PKC inhibitor is
	required to block beta(2) integrin mobility in dynamitin-expressing
	cells. Although dynamitin acts at the point of MacMARCKS phosphorylation,
	it is upstream of RhoA, because its effect was blocked by RhoA inhibitor.
	Thus, we conclude that dynamitin is a part of the cytoskeletal constraint
	that locks beta(2) integrin in the inactive form.},

	that tracer diffusion was generally independent of filament length
	in agreement with theoretical predictions for diffusion through solutions

	short (< or = 1.0 micron) filaments, although this result was not

	unregulated F-actin and filaments of lengths > 1.0 micron were more
	rapid than predicted by theory for tracer diffusion through rigid,

	Avidin-induced cross-linking of biotinylated F-actin did not affect

	was slower through short filaments this cross-linking method resulted
	in enhanced tracer diffusion rates indistinguishable from unregulated

	particles were circular in focus but ellipsoidal above and below

	through focus. Particle z position was determined from the image
	shape and orientation by applying a peak detection algorithm to image
	projections along the x and y axes; x, y position was determined
	from the centroid of the particle image. Typical spatial resolution
	was 12 nm along the optical axis and 5 nm in the image plane with
	a maximum sampling rate of 3-4 Hz. The method was applied to track
	fluorescent particles in artificial solutions and living cells. In
	a solution of viscosity 30 cP, the mean squared distance (MSD) traveled

	Statistical variability of MSD curves for a freely diffusing bead

	submembrane barriers, or skeleton fences that hinder long-range diffusion

	focus of this paper. One way to approach this question is to determine
	the dependence of particle motion on particle size. Some current
	models predict that the diffusion coefficient of a membrane protein

	We have measured the diffusion coefficients of membrane glycoprotein
	aggregates linked together by concanavalin A molecules bound to beads
	of various sizes, and also the diffusion coefficients of individual
	concanavalin A binding proteins. The measurements demonstrate at

  abstract = {The active forward movement of cells is often associated with the
	rearward transport of particles over the surfaces of their lamellae.
	Unlike the rest of the lamella, we found that the leading edge (within
	0.5 microns of the cell boundary) is specialized for rearward transport
	of membrane-bound particles, such as Con A-coated latex microspheres.
	Using a single-beam optical gradient trap (optical tweezers) to apply
	restraining forces to particles, we can capture, move and release
	particles at will. When first bound on the central lamellar surface,
	Con A-coated particles would diffuse randomly; when such bound particles
	were brought to the leading edge of the lamella with the optical
	tweezers, they were often transported rearward. As in our previous
	studies, particle transport occurred with a concurrent decrease in
	apparent diffusion coefficient, consistent with attachment to the
	cytoskeleton. For particles at the leading edge of the lamella, weak
	attachment to the cytoskeleton and transport occurred with a half-time
	of 3 s; equivalent particles elsewhere on the lamella showed no detectable
	attachment when monitored for several minutes. Particles held on
	the cell surface by the laser trap attached more strongly to the
	cytoskeleton with time. These particles could escape a trapping force
	of 0.7 X 10(-6) dyne after 18 +/- 14 (sd) s at the leading edge,
	and after 64 +/- 34 (SD) s elsewhere on the lamella. Fluorescent
	succinylated Con A staining showed no corresponding concentration
	of general glycoproteins at the leading edge, but cytochalasin D-resistant
	filamentous actin was found at the leading edge. Our results have
	implications for cell motility: if the forces used for rearward particle
	transport were applied to a rigid substratum, cells would move forward.
	Such a mechanism would be most efficient if the leading edge of the
	cell contained preferential sites for attachment and transport.},

	of integrins from cytoskeletal constraints. To determine whether
	changes in integrin-cytoskeleton interactions were related to activation
	of the integrin, we used single particle tracking to examine focal
	contact-independent cytoskeletal associations of alpha(IIb)beta(3)-integrin,
	in which activation results in a large conformational change. Direct
	activation of alpha(IIb)beta(3) by mutation did not mimic activation

	additional integrin mutants, we found that both alpha- and beta-cytoplasmic

	beta(2)- and beta(3)-integrins interact with the cytoskeleton outside

	latex beads have revealed several important features of the motors
	which underlie basic mechanical aspects of the mechanisms of motor
	movements. Kinesin-coated beads will move along the paths of individual
	microtubule protofilaments with high fidelity and will pause at 4
	nm intervals along the microtubule axis under low ATP conditions.
	In contrast, cytoplasmic dynein-coated beads move laterally across
	many protofilaments as they travel along the microtubule, without
	any regular pauses, suggesting that the movements of kinesin-coated
	beads are not an artefact of the method. These kinesin bead movements
	suggest a model for kinesin movement in which the two heads walk
	along an individual protofilament in a hand-over-hand fashion. A
	free head would only be able to bind to the next forward tubulin
	subunit on the protofilament and its binding would pull off the trailing
	head to start the cycle again. This model is consistent with the
	observed cooperativity between the heads and with the movement by
	single dimeric molecules. Several testable predictions of the model
	are that kinesin should be able to bind to both alpha and beta tubulin
	and that the length of the neck region of the molecule should control
	the off-axis motility. In this article, we describe the technology
	for measuring nanometer-level movements and the force generated by
	the kinesin molecule.},

	transferrin receptor in the plasma membrane of a cultured mouse keratinocyte
	cell line were studied using both single particle tracking (SPT;
	nanovid microscopy) and fluorescence photobleaching recovery (FPR).
	In the SPT technique, the receptor molecules are labeled with 40
	nm-phi colloidal gold particles, and their movements are followed
	by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy at
	a temporal resolution of 33 ms and at a nanometer-level spatial precision.
	The trajectories of the receptor molecules obtained by SPT were analyzed
	by developing a method that is based on the plot of the mean-square
	displacement against time. Four characteristic types of motion were
	observed: (a) stationary mode, in which the microscopic diffusion
	coefficient is less than 4.6 x 10(-12) cm2/s; (b) simple Brownian
	diffusion mode; (c) directed diffusion mode, in which unidirectional
	movements are superimposed on random motion; and (d) confined diffusion
	mode, in which particles undergoing Brownian diffusion (microscopic
	diffusion coefficient between 4.6 x 10(-12) and 1 x 10(-9) cm2/s)
	are confined within a limited area, probably by the membrane-associated
	cytoskeleton network. Comparison of these data obtained by SPT with
	those obtained by FPR suggests that the plasma membrane is compartmentalized
	into many small domains 300-600 nm in diameter (0.04-0.24 microns2
	in area), in which receptor molecules are confined in the time scale
	of 3-30 s, and that the long-range diffusion observed by FPR can
	occur by successive movements of the receptors to adjacent compartments.
	Calcium-induced differentiation decreases the sum of the percentages
	of molecules in the directed diffusion and the stationary modes outside
	of the cell-cell contact regions on the cell surface (which is proposed
	to be the percentage of E-cadherin bound to the cytoskeleton/membrane-skeleton),

	the fluorescence lifetime decay under the fluorescence microscope.
	This system allows one to measure the nanosecond fluorescence lifetimes
	of fluorophores in a small spot (0.8-6.3 microns diameter) in single
	cultured cells under a fluorescence microscope, while the cells are
	being viewed under a high-power objective lens. A signal acquisition
	time between a second and a minute was usually sufficient to obtain
	fluorescence decay curves with good quality for 10(3)-10(5) fluorophores
	localized in 1 microns 2 domain. A signal-to-noise ratio better than
	30 was obtained for approximately 30,000 fluorescein-labeled band
	3 molecules in a 2 microns 2 region in a single human erythrocyte
	ghost after signal accumulation for 30 s. The measured lifetimes
	for a variety of fluorescent probes attached to proteins in solution
	and lipids in liposomes showed a good agreement with those measured
	in a cuvette under standard conditions by time-correlated single
	photon counting. With the development of this instrument, microscope
	fluorimetry has become a practical, straightforward, quantitative
	technique for investigation of molecular processes in single cells
	in culture. Time-resolved microscope fluorimetry has been applied
	to observe fusion of liposomes in vitro and that of endosomes in
	single cells by monitoring resonance energy transfer. Inspection
	of individual liposomes and endosomes revealed the extent of fusion
	for each vesicle. Since the use of time-resolved microscope fluorimetry
	eliminates the need for subcellular fractionation or the complex
	correction procedures in steady-state microfluorimetry, it greatly
	simplifies the assay for endosome fusion in vivo. The results showed
	that extensive fusion of sequentially formed endosomes takes place
	all over the cell matrix in cultured cells. This suggests that extensive
	fusion with incoming endosomes takes place in many endosomal compartments,
	possibly sorting organelles, or that the early endosomes fuse with
	the preexisting network of tubular cisternae of the endosomal compartment
	at many points in the network. It is concluded that time-resolved
	microscope fluorimetry is a powerful noninvasive technique for studies
	of in situ biochemistry and biophysics using cells and tissues.},

	To dissect their mode of action, we developed an approach based on

	tweezers and video microscopy to investigate the dynamics of N-cadherin

	analysis of the bead movement by single-particle tracking indicated
	that N-cadherin molecules were freely diffusive in the first few
	seconds after bead binding. The beads rapidly became diffusion-restricted
	and underwent an oriented rearward movement as a result of N-cadherin
	anchoring to the actin cytoskeleton. The kinetics of anchoring were
	dependent on ligand density, suggesting that it was an inducible
	process triggered by active cadherin recruitment. This anchoring
	was inhibited by the dominant negative form of Rac1, but not that
	of Cdc42. The Rac1 mutant had no effect on cell contact formation

	Here we show, by using differential interference contrast microscopy,
	that a 'hot-spot' mutation in K14 greatly reduces the ability of

	Rheological assays measure similar small-deformation mechanical responses
	for crosslinked solutions of wild-type and mutant keratins. The mutation,
	however, markedly reduces the resilience of crosslinked networks
	against large deformations. Single-particle tracking, which probes
	the local organization of filament networks, shows that the mutant
	polymer exhibits highly heterogeneous structures compared to those
	of wild-type filaments. Our results indicate that the fragility of

	unconventional myosin motors that move along actin filaments. Each

	their single-molecule properties and the possibilities for regulation

	cytoplasmic dynein is less efficient and robust, to achieve function
	comparable to the other motors it requires a number of accessory
	proteins as well as multiple dyneins functioning together. This necessity
	for additional factors, as well as dynein's inherent complexity,

	taking the factors away either singly or in combination. Thus, dynein's

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structural studies of fixed cells have revealed that interphase
	chromosomes are highly organized into specific arrangements in the
	nucleus, and have led to a picture of the nucleus as a static structure
	with immobile chromosomes held in fixed positions, an impression
	apparently confirmed by recent photobleaching studies. Functional
	studies of chromosome behavior, however, suggest that many essential
	processes, such as recombination, require interphase chromosomes
	to move around within the nucleus. RESULTS: To reconcile these contradictory
	views, we exploited methods for tagging specific chromosome sites
	in living cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with green fluorescent
	protein and in Drosophila melanogaster with fluorescently labeled
	topoisomerase ll. Combining these techniques with submicrometer single-particle
	tracking, we directly measured the motion of interphase chromatin,
	at high resolution and in three dimensions. We found that chromatin
	does indeed undergo significant diffusive motion within the nucleus,
	but this motion is constrained such that a given chromatin segment
	is free to move within only a limited subregion of the nucleus. Chromatin
	diffusion was found to be insensitive to metabolic inhibitors, suggesting
	that it results from classical Brownian motion rather than from active
	motility. Nocodazole greatly reduced chromatin confinement, suggesting
	a role for the cytoskeleton in the maintenance of nuclear architecture.
	CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that chromatin is free to undergo substantial
	Brownian motion, but that a given chromatin segment is confined to
	a subregion of the nucleus. This constrained diffusion is consistent
	with a highly defined nuclear architecture, but also allows enough
	motion for processes requiring chromosome motility to take place.
	These results lead to a model for the regulation of chromosome interactions
	by nuclear architecture.},

	To address these issues, we examined the locomotive structure and

	and confocal microscopy, we identified key morphological differences

	important functional similarities. In 3D matrices, ECs formed cylindrical
	branching pseudopodia, while on 2D substrata they formed wide flat
	lamellae. Three distinct cytoplasmic zones were identified in both
	conditions: (i) a small, F-actin-rich, rapidly moving peripheral
	zone, (ii) a larger, more stable, intermediate zone characterized
	by abundant microtubules and small organelles, and (iii) a locomotively

	cytoplasmic viscosity or cytoplasmic structure on diffusion. The

	averaged 3.3 X 10(-6) cm2/sec in several cell lines. It was greater

	We used single-particle tracking to follow in real time, on the cell
	surface, movements of the glycine receptor (GlyR) with or without
	the GlyR stabilizing protein gephyrin. GlyR alternated within seconds
	between diffusive and confined states. In the absence of gephyrin,
	GlyR were mostly freely diffusing. Gephyrin induced long confinement
	periods spatially associated with submembranous clusters of gephyrin.
	However, even when most receptors were stabilized, they still frequently
	made transitions through the diffusive state. These data show that
	receptor number in a cluster results from a dynamic equilibrium between
	the pools of stabilized and freely mobile receptors. Modification

  abstract = {Although small molecules such as ATP diffuse freely in the cytosol,
	many types of cells nonetheless position their mitochondria in regions
	of intense ATP consumption. We reasoned that in the highly elongated
	axonal processes of growing neurons in culture, the active growth
	cone would form a focus of ATP consumption so distant from the cell
	body as to require the positioning of mitochondria nearby via regulated
	axonal transport. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the distribution
	and transport behavior of mitochondria in live, aerobically respiring
	chick sympathetic neurons. We found that in the distal region of
	actively growing axons, the distribution of mitochondria was highly
	skewed toward the growth cone, with a sevenfold higher density in
	the region immediately adjacent to the growth cone than in the region
	100 microns away. When axonal outgrowth was blocked by substratum-associated
	barriers or mild cytochalasin E treatment, the gradient of mitochondrial
	distribution collapsed as mitochondria exited retrogradely from the
	distal region, becoming uniformly distributed along the axon within
	one hour. Analysis of individual mitochondrial behaviors revealed
	that mitochondrial movement everywhere was bidirectional but balanced
	so that net transport was anterograde in growing axons and retrograde
	in blocked axons. This reversal in net transport derived from two
	separate modulations of mitochondrial movement. First, moving mitochondria
	underwent a transition to a persistently stationary state in the
	region of active growth cones that was reversed when growth cone
	activity was halted. Second, the fraction of time that mitochondria
	spent moving anterogradely was sharply reduced in non-growing axons.
	Together, these could account for the formation of gradients of mitochondria
	in growing axons and their dissipation when outgrowth was blocked.
	This regulated transport behavior was not dependent upon the ability
	of mitochondria to produce ATP. Our data indicate that mitochondria
	possess distinct motor activities for both directions of movement
	and that mitochondrial transport in axons is regulated by both recruitment
	between stationary and moving states, and direct regulation of the
	anterograde motor.},

	The in vivo binding interactions of several different transcription
	factors with chromatin have been investigated recently using quantitative
	fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). These analyses
	have yielded significantly different estimates of both the binding
	rates and the number of predicted binding states of the respective
	transcription factors. We show here that these discrepancies are
	not due to fundamental differences among the site-specific transcription
	factors, but rather arise from errors in FRAP modeling. The two principal
	errors are a neglect of diffusion's role and an oversimplified approximation
	of the photobleach profile. Accounting for these errors by developing
	a revised FRAP protocol eliminates most of the previous discrepancies
	in the binding estimates for the three different transcription factors
	analyzed here. The new estimates predict that for each of the three
	transcription factors, approximately 75% of the molecules are freely
	diffusing within the nucleus, whereas the remainder is bound with
	an average residence time of approximately 2.5 s to a single type
	of chromatin binding site. Such consistent predictions for three
	different molecules suggest that many site-specific transcription
	factors may exhibit similar in vivo interactions with native chromatin.},

	regulates ALCAM-mediated cell adhesion because inhibition of actin
	polymerization by cytochalasin D (CytD) strongly induces homotypic
	ALCAM-ALCAM interactions. This induction of cell adhesion is likely
	due to clustering of ALCAM at the cell surface, which is observed
	after CytD treatment. Single-particle tracking demonstrated that
	the lateral mobility of ALCAM in the cell membrane is increased 30-fold
	after CytD treatment. In contrast, both surface distribution and
	adhesion of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored ALCAM mutant
	are insensitive to CytD, despite the increase in lateral mobility
	of GPI-ALCAM upon CytD treatment. This demonstrates that clustering
	of ALCAM is essential for cell adhesion, whereas enhanced diffusion
	of ALCAM alone is not sufficient for cluster formation. In addition,
	upon ligand binding, both free diffusion and the freely dragged distance
	of wild-type ALCAM, but not of GPI-ALCAM, are reduced over time,
	suggesting strengthening of the cytoskeleton linkage. From these
	findings we conclude that activation of ALCAM-mediated adhesion is

	developed that takes advantage of the spatial variations of fluorescence
	lifetimes in single cells as a source of image contrast, and thus
	it is named "fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (flimscopy)".
	Since time-resolved fluorescence measurements are sensitive to molecular
	dynamics and interactions, flimscopy allows the molecular information
	to be visualized in single cells. In flimscopy measurements, several
	(nanosecond) time-resolved fluorescence images of a sample are obtained
	at various delay times after pulsed laser excitation of the microscope's
	entire field of view. Lifetimes are calculated pixel-by-pixel from
	these time-resolved images, and the spatial variations of the lifetimes
	are then displayed in a pseudocolor format (flimscopy image). The
	total data acquisition time needed to obtain a flimscopy image with
	the diffraction-limited spatial resolution (approximately 250 nm)
	is decreased to just approximately 30 s for approximately 300 fluorescent
	molecules/micron2. This was achieved by developing a high-frequency
	(400 kHz) nanosecond-gating (9 ns full width at half height)-signal
	accumulation system. This technique allows the extent of resonance
	energy transfer to be visualized in single living cells, and is free
	from the errors due to variations in path length, light scattering,
	and the number of fluorophores that necessitate complex corrections

	This finding is strongly supported by the observation that LFA-1
	exhibits a more diffusive motion when the cytoskeleton network is
	disrupted and confirmed by the optical trap measurements used to

	a first version of a software for automated analysis of FSM movies.
	We focus on mapping the assembly and disassembly kinetics of a polymer

	in live newt lung epithelial cells. We lay out the algorithm in detail

	phases of polymerization alternate with depolymerization in a spatially
	coordinated fashion. The cycle rates change when treating cells with
	a low dose of the drug latrunculin A. This shows the potential of
	this technique for future quantitative screening of drugs affecting

	A laser trap was used to confine the motion of a bead bound to a

	Using protein constructs with identical ectodomains and different

	existing gradient-based snakes in the form of a modified gradient
	vector flow. Using the gradient vector flow, we can track leukocytes
	rolling at high speeds that are not amenable to tracking with the
	existing edge-based techniques. We also propose a new energy-based
	implicit sampling method of the points on the active contour that
	replaces the computationally expensive explicit method. To enhance
	the performance of this shape and size constrained snake model, we
	have coupled it with Kalman filter so that during coasting (when
	the leukocytes are completely occluded or obscured), the tracker
	may infer the location of the center of the leukocyte. Finally, we
	have compared the performance of the proposed snake tracker with
	that of the correlation and centroid-based trackers. The proposed
	snake tracker results in superior performance measures, such as reduced
	error in locating the leukocyte under tracking and improvements in
	the percentage of frames successfully tracked. For screening and
	drug validation, the tracker shows promise as an automated data collection
	tool.},

	popular for non-invasive flow mapping of the hydrodynamics in multiphase
	reactors. Based on gamma-ray sensitization of an array of scintillation

	technique measures flow fields by monitoring the actual motion path
	of a single discrete radioactive flow follower which has the physical
	properties of the phase whose motion is being followed. A limitation
	to the accuracy of CARPT lies in the error associated with the reconstruction

	capability of the technique. It is of interest, therefore, to minimize
	this error by choosing wisely the best hardware and an optimal configuration
	of CARPT detectors' array. Such choices are currently based on experience,
	without firm scientific basis. In this paper, through theoretical
	modeling and simulation, we describe how the accuracy of a radioactive

	of a proposed implementation of CARPT on a gas-solids riser, we demonstrate

	J. Cell Biol. 125:1251-1264). In the present study, we characterized
	the properties of intercompartmental boundaries by tagging transferrin
	receptor (TR) with either 210-nm-phi latex or 40-nm-phi colloidal
	gold particles, and by dragging the particle-TR complexes laterally
	along the plasma membrane using laser tweezers. Approximately 90%
	of the TR-particle complexes showed confined-type diffusion with
	a microscopic diffusion coefficient (Dmicro) of approximately 10(-9)
	cm2/s and could be dragged past the intercompartmental boundaries
	in their path by laser tweezers at a trapping force of 0.25 pN for
	gold-tagged TR and 0.8 pN for latex-tagged TR. At lower dragging
	forces between 0.05 and 0.1 pN, particle-TR complexes tended to escape
	from the laser trap at the boundaries, and such escape occurred in
	both the forward and backward directions of dragging. The average
	distance dragged was half of the confined distance of TR, which further
	indicates that particle-TR complexes escape at the compartment boundaries.
	Since variation in the particle size (40 and 210 nm, the particles
	are on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane) hardly affects
	the diffusion rate and behavior of the particle-TR complexes at the
	compartment boundaries, and since treatment with cytochalasin D or
	vinblastin affects the movements of TR (Sako and Kusumi as cited
	above), argument has been advanced that the boundaries are present
	in the cytoplasmic domain. Rebound of the particle-TR complexes when
	they escape from the laser tweezers at the compartment boundaries
	suggests that the boundaries are elastic structures. These results
	are consistent with the proposal that the compartment boundaries
	consist of membrane skeleton or a membrane-associated part of the
	cytoskeleton (membrane skeleton fence model). Approximately 10% of
	TR exhibited slower diffusion (Dmicro approximately 10(-10)-10(-11)

	via a monoclonal antibody to the extracellular domain of E-cadherin
	for SPT or OT experiments, respectively. E-cadherin on the dorsal

	Catenin-minus and Short-tailed could be dragged an average of 1.1

	Short-tailed was greater by a factor of four. In contrast, Fusion

	of the wild-type E-cadherin in the plasma membrane are regulated
	via the cytoplasmic domain by (a) tethering to actin filaments through
	catenin(s) (like Fusion) and (b) a corralling effect of the network

	microscopy (UV-CLSM) in terms of three-dimensional (3-D) calcium
	imaging of living cells in culture. Indo-1 was used as a calcium
	indicator. Since the excitation volume is more limited and excitation
	wavelengths are longer in 2p-LSM than in UV-CLSM, 2p-LSM exhibited
	several advantages over UV-CLSM: (1) a lower level of background
	signal by a factor of 6-17, which enhances the contrast by a factor
	of 6-21: (2) a lower rate of photobleaching by a factor of 2-4; (3)
	slightly lower phototoxicity. When 3-D images were repeatedly acquired,
	the calcium concentration determined by UV-CLSM depended strongly
	on the number of data acquisitions and the nuclear regions falsely
	exhibited low calcium concentrations. probably due to an interplay
	of different levels of photobleaching of Indo-1 and autofluorescence,
	while the calcium concentration evaluated by 2p-LSM was stable and
	homogeneous throughout the cytoplasm. The spatial resolution of 2p-LSM
	was worse by 10% in the focal plane and by 30% along the optical
	axis due to the longer excitation wavelength. This disadvantage can
	be overcome by the addition of a confocal pinhole (two-photon excitation
	confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy), which made the
	resolution similar to that in UV-CLSM. These results indicate that
	2p-LSM is preferable for repeated 3-D reconstruction of calcium concentration
	in living cells. In UV-CLSM, 0.18-mW laser power with a 2.6-phi pinhole
	(in normalized optical coordinate) gives better signal-to-noise ratio,
	contrast and resolution than 0.09-mW laser power with a 4.9-phi pinhole.
	However, since the damage to cells and the rate of photobleaching
	is substantially greater under the former condition, it is not suitable
	for repeated acquisition of 3-D images.},

	diffusion of proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
	is studied using cell biological and computational methods. Fluorescence
	recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments are performed in
	tissue culture cells expressing GFP-KDEL, a soluble, fluorescent
	protein, in the ER lumen. The three-dimensional (3D) shape of the
	ER is determined by confocal microscopy and computationally reconstructed.
	Within these ER geometries diffusion of solutes is simulated using
	the method of particle strength exchange. The simulations are compared
	to experimental FRAP curves of GFP-KDEL in the same ER region. Comparisons
	of simulations in the 3D ER shapes to simulations in open 3D space
	show that the constraints imposed by the spatial confinement result
	in two- to fourfold underestimation of the molecular diffusion constant
	in the ER if the geometry is not taken into account. Using the same
	molecular diffusion constant in different simulations, the observed
	speed of fluorescence recovery varies by a factor of 2.5, depending

	Organelle shape considerably influences diffusive transport and must
	be taken into account when relating experimental photobleaching data

  abstract = {The lateral mobility of lipids in phospholipid membranes has attracted
	numerous experimental and theoretical studies, inspired by the model
	of Singer and Nicholson (1972. Science, 175:720-731) and the theoretical
	description by Saffman and Delbruck (1975. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
	USA. 72:3111-3113). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)
	is used as the standard experimental technique for the study of lateral
	mobility, yielding an ensemble-averaged diffusion constant. Single-particle
	tracking (SPT) and the recently developed single-molecule imaging
	techniques now give access to data on individual displacements of
	molecules, which can be used for characterization of the mobility
	in a membrane. Here we present a new type of analysis for tracking
	data by making use of the probability distribution of square displacements.
	The potential of this new type of analysis is shown for single-molecule
	imaging, which was employed to follow the motion of individual fluorescence-labeled
	lipids in two systems: a fluid-supported phospholipid membrane and
	a solid polymerstabilized phospholipid monolayer. In the fluid membrane,
	a high-mobility component characterized by a diffusion constant of
	4.4 microns2/s and a low-mobility component characterized by a diffusion
	constant of 0.07 micron2/s were identified. It is proposed that the
	latter characterizes the so-called immobile fraction often found
	in FRAP experiments. In the polymer-stabilized system, diffusion
	restricted to corrals of 140 nm was directly visualized. Both examples
	show the potentials of such detailed analysis in combination with
	single-molecule techniques: with minimal interference with the native
	structure, inhomogeneities of membrane mobility can be resolved with
	a spatial resolution of 100 nm, well below the diffraction limit.},

  abstract = {The large Oder (Szczecin) Lagoon (687 km2) at the German-Polish border,
	close to the Baltic Sea, suffers from severe eutrophication and water
	quality problems due to high discharge of water, nutrients and pollutants
	by the river Oder. Sewage treatment around the lagoon has been very
	much improved during the last years, but large amounts of sewage
	still enter the Oder river. Human pathogenic viruses generally can
	be expected in all surface waters that are affected by municipal
	sewage. There is an increasing awareness that predisposed persons
	can be infected by a few infective units or even a single active
	virus. Another new aspect is, that at least polioviruses attached
	to suspended particles can be infective for weeks and therefore be
	transported over long distances. Therefore, the highest risk of virus
	inputs arise from the large amounts of untreated sewage of the city
	of Szczecin (Poland), which are released into the river Oder and
	transported to the lagoon and the Baltic Sea. Summer tourism is the
	most important economical factor in this coastal region and further
	growth is expected. Human pathogenic viruses might be a serious problem
	for bathing water quality and sustainable summer tourism. The potential
	hazard of virus infections along beaches and shores of the Oder lagoon
	and adjacent parts of the Baltic Sea is evaluated on the basis of
	model simulations and laboratory results. We used two scenarios for
	the Older Lagoon considering free viruses and viruses attached to
	suspended particle matter. The spatial impact of the average virus
	release in the city of Szczecin during summer (bathing period) was
	simulated with a hydrodynamic and particle tracking model. Simulations
	suggest that due to fast inactivation, free viruses in the water
	represent a risk only in the river and near the river mouth. On the
	other hand, viruses attached to suspended matter can affect large
	areas of the eastern, Polish part of the lagoon (Grosses Haff). At
	the same time the accumulation of viruses on suspended particulate
	matter increases the likelihood of an infection after incorporation
	of such a particle. There is no evidence, that there is a risk of
	virus infections in the western part of the lagoon (Kleines Haff)
	or along the outer Baltic Sea coast.},

	interest in the development of applications ranging from cellular
	biosensors to tissue engineering. We have produced rectangular networks
	of functional rat hippocampal neurons on silicon oxide surfaces.
	Attachment and network formation of neurons was guided by a geometrical
	grid pattern of the adhesion peptide PA22-2 which matches in sequence
	a part of the A-chain of laminin. PA22-2 was applied by contact printing
	onto the functionalised silicon oxide surface and was immobilised
	by hetero-bifunctional cross-linking with sulfo-GMBS. Geometric pattern
	matching was achieved by microcontact printing using a polydimethylsiloxane
	(PDMS) stamp. In this way the produced grid pattern ranged from 3
	to 20 microm in line width and from 50 to 100 microm in line distances.
	As shown by atomic force microscopy (AFM), line widths and line distances
	of the peptide pattern differ less than 0.5 microm from the used
	PDMS stamp. The height of the layer of immobilised PA22-2 was approximately
	3.5 nm implying the layer to be monomolecular. Immobilised PA22-2
	was capable of binding anti-PA22-2 antibodies indicating that the
	function of the peptide was not compromised by immobilisation. Rat
	hippocampal neurons, cultured at low density in serum-free medium,
	were applied to the growth matrix of PA22-2-coated substrates and,
	within 1-3 h of culture, formed a network-like pattern that more
	or less matched the printed grid. Reliability and reproducibility
	of neuronal network formation depended on the geometry, line width
	and node diameter of the grid pattern. The immobilised neurons showed
	resting membrane potentials comparable with controls and, already
	after 1 day of culture, were capable of eliciting action potentials.
	The suitability of the immobilised neurons for the study of man-made
	neural networks and for multi-site recordings from a functional neuronal
	network is discussed.},

	The physical and chemical properties of the samples have been extensively

	their properties in terms of cell responses during the initial 24h
	of cell culture. Regarding the cell number and activity there was

	However the morphology of cells on vanadium surfaces became spindle-like.
	In contrast to the behaviour on single metal samples, cells exhibited
	a pronounced reaction on bimetallic surfaces that contained aluminium.
	Cells tended to stay away from aluminium, which was the least favoured
	metal in all two-metal combinations. An initial cell alignment relative
	to the pattern geometry was detectable after 2h and was fully developed
	after 18h of incubation. The organisation of f-actin and microtubules
	as well as the localisation of vinculin were all more pronounced
	on non-aluminium regions. We hypothesised that the differences in
	cell response could be associated with differences in the adsorption

	experiments were performed using microscopy in conjunction with immunofluorescent
	stains. They indicated that both fibronectin and albumin adsorption

  abstract = {The plasma membranes of migrating cells differentiate into at least
	three distinct domains as defined by the laser tweezers and the motile
	behaviour of particles bound to specific membrane glycoproteins.
	These domains are important for steps in the cell migration process.
	First, there is a domain at the leading edge of the lamellipodium
	where preferential attachment of cross-linked glycoproteins to the
	cytoskeleton occurs. The second domain at the rear of the cell is
	differentiated for releasing from substrata and shows decreased support
	of the membrane by the cytoskeleton. The third domain is the highly
	curved region(s) of the plasma membrane wherein certain membrane
	glycoproteins concentrate and is a site for controlling extension
	and attachment. Using single particle tracking and video analysis
	we find that the quantitative differences between plasma membrane
	domains are in the 4-20-fold range at any given time. These values
	are consistent with the rapid fluctuations seen in cell migration
	rates and directions. Over a longer time-scale, cells can possibly
	integrate these selective advantages to give a much higher overall
	fidelity for cell chemotaxis and neuronal path finding.},

  abstract = {Membrane traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi
	complex is regulated by two vesicular coat complexes, COPII and COPI.
	COPII has been implicated in the selective packaging of anterograde
	cargo into coated transport vesicles budding from the ER [1]. In
	mammalian cells, these vesicles coalesce to form tubulo-vesicular
	transport complexes (TCs), which shuttle anterograde cargo from the
	ER to the Golgi complex [2] [3] [4]. In contrast, COPI-coated vesicles
	are proposed to mediate recycling of proteins from the Golgi complex
	to the ER [1] [5] [6] [7]. The binding of COPI to COPII-coated TCs
	[3] [8] [9], however, has led to the proposal that COPI binds to
	TCs and specifically packages recycling proteins into retrograde
	vesicles for return to the ER [3] [9]. To test this hypothesis, we
	tracked fluorescently tagged COPI and anterograde-transport markers
	simultaneously in living cells. COPI predominated on TCs shuttling
	anterograde cargo to the Golgi complex and was rarely observed on
	structures moving in directions consistent with retrograde transport.
	Furthermore, a progressive segregation of COPI-rich domains and anterograde-cargo-rich
	domains was observed in the TCs. This segregation and the directed
	motility of COPI-containing TCs were inhibited by antibodies that
	blocked COPI function. These observations, which are consistent with
	previous biochemical data [2] [9], suggest a role for COPI within
	TCs en route to the Golgi complex. By sequestering retrograde cargo
	in the anterograde-directed TCs, COPI couples the sorting of ER recycling
	proteins [10] to the transport of anterograde cargo.},

	human NCAM, differing in their ectodomain, their membrane anchorage
	mode, or the size of their cytoplasmic domain, were expressed in
	National Institutes of Health 3T3 cells and C2C12 muscle cells. On

	(GPI) anchored isoforms of NCAM expressed in 3T3 cells could be classified
	into mobile (Brownian diffusion), slow diffusion, corralled diffusion,
	and immobile subpopulations. On a 90-s time scale, SPT studies in
	C2C12 cells revealed that 40-60% of transfected NCAM was mobile,
	whereas a smaller fraction (approximately 10-30%) experienced much
	slower diffusion. In addition, a fraction of approximately 30% of
	both transfected GPI and transmembrane isoforms and endogenous NCAM
	isoforms in C2C12 cells experienced transient confinement for approximately
	8 s within regions of approximately 300-nm diameter. Diffusion within

	outside these regions was normal. Thus the membrane appears as a
	mosaic containing regions that permit free diffusion as well as regions
	in which NCAM is transiently confined to small or more extended domains.
	These results, including a large, freely diffusing fraction, similar

	in soft matter and biological systems. However, the onset of long-range
	microscopic ordering has not been explored in randomly moving self-propelled
	particles due to a lack of model systems as well as local probe techniques.
	In this article, we report on a novel experiment, using motile Escherichia
	coli bacteria as a model system, to study the onset of dynamic correlation
	and collective movement in three-dimension. We use fluctuation of
	an optically trapped micron-size bead as a detector of correlated
	bacterial motion, and further study this behavior by analyzing the
	motility of fluorescent bacteria in a confocal volume. We find evidence
	of dynamic correlation at very low volume fractions (0.01). We show
	that the magnitude of this correlation strongly depends on the interbacterial
	distances and their coupling modes. This opens up possibilities to
	probe long-range pattern formation in actively propelled cells or
	organisms coupled through hydrodynamics and/or chemical signaling.},

	idealized solutions have been identified for the reaction-diffusion
	equations that govern FRAP, there has been no comprehensive analysis

	solution to the various idealized cases. This yields a coherent approach
	to extract binding information from FRAP data which we have applied

	We show that within the nucleus, the glucocorticoid receptor is transiently
	bound to a single state, with each molecule binding on average 65
	sites per second. This rapid sampling is likely to be important in
	finding a specific promoter target sequence. Further we show that
	this predominant binding state is not the nuclear matrix, as some
	studies have suggested. We illustrate how our analysis provides several
	self-consistency checks on a FRAP fit. We also define constraints
	on what can be estimated from FRAP data, show that diffusion should
	play a key role in many FRAP recoveries, and provide tools to test
	its contribution. Overall our approach establishes a more general

	in the wide field of X-ray spectroscopy: fluorescent analysis, diffractometry,
	materials analysis, and synchrotron experiments such as X-ray holography
	and element imaging in scanning electron microscopes. The fact that
	the detector system can be used at room temperature with good spectroscopic
	performance and at -10 degrees C with excellent energy resolution,
	avoiding liquid nitrogen for cooling and high-quality vacuum, guarantees
	a large variety of new applications, independent of the laboratory
	environment. A brief description of the device principles is followed
	by basics on low noise amplification. The performance results of
	a complete detector system are presented as well as some dedicated
	applications already realized, including use in a surface mapping
	instrument and use of a "mini-spectrometer" for the analysis of works
	of art. Fully depleted pn-charge-coupled devices (pn-CCDs) have been
	fabricated for the European X-ray Multi-Mirror mission (XMM) and
	the German X-ray satellite ABRIXAS, enabling high-speed, low-noise,
	position-resolving X-ray spectroscopy. The detector was designed
	and fabricated with a homogeneously sensitive area of 36 cm2. At
	-70 degrees C it has a noise of 4 e- rms, with a readout time of
	the total focal plane array of 4 msec. The maximum count rate for
	single photon counting was 10(5) cps under flat field conditions.
	In the integration mode, more than 10(9) cps can be detected at 6
	keV. Its position resolution is on the order of 100 microm. The quantum
	efficiency is higher than 90%, ranging from carbon K X-rays (277
	eV) up to 10 keV.},

	the motility of C6 glioma and primary mouse fibroblast cells is diminished.
	Nevertheless, nuclei perform an unexpected auto-reverse motion: when
	a migrating nucleus approaches the leading edge, it decelerates,
	changes the direction of motion, and accelerates to move toward the

	are transitory, since cells permanently disassemble and reassemble
	their cytoskeleton while moving. Adhesive micropatterns are commonly
	used to confine cell shape within a given geometry. In addition the
	micropattern can be designed so as to impose cells to spread upon
	adhesive and nonadhesive areas. Modulation of the pattern geometry
	allows the analysis of the mechanisms governing the determination
	of cell shape in response to external adhesive conditions. In this
	study, we show that the acquisition of cell shape follows two stages
	where initially the cell forms contact with the micropattern. Here,
	the most distal contacts made by the cell with the micropattern define
	the apices of the cell shape. Then secondly, the cell borders that
	link two apices move so as to minimise the distance between the two
	apices. In these cell borders, the absence of an underlying adhesive
	substrate is overcome by stress fibres forming between the apices,
	which in turn are marked by an accumulation of focal adhesions. By
	inhibiting myosin function, cell borders on nonadhesive zones become
	more concave, suggesting that the stress fibres work against the
	membrane tension in the cell border. Moreover, this suggested that
	traction forces are unevenly distributed in stationary, nonmigrating,
	cells. By comparing the stress fibres in cells with one, two, or
	three nonadherent cell borders it was reasoned that stress fibre
	strength is inversely proportional to number. We conclude that cells
	of a given area can generate the same total sum of tractional forces
	but that these tractional forces are differently spaced depending
	on the spatial distribution of its adherence contacts.},

	Motility and rheology data are presented for pulmonary macrophages
	isolated from lungs of hamsters 1 d after the animals had breathed
	airborne gamma-Fe2O3 particles. The magnetic directions of particles
	within phagosomes and secondary lysosomes were aligned, and the weak
	magnetic field produced by the particles was recorded. For dead cells,
	this remanent field was constant, but for viable macrophages, the
	remanent field decreased rapidly so that only 42% of its initial
	magnitude remained 5 min after alignment. A twisting field was applied
	perpendicular to the direction of alignment and the rate at which
	particles reoriented to this new direction was followed. The same
	twisting was repeated for particles suspended in a series of viscosity
	standards. Based on this approach, the low-shear apparent intracellular
	viscosity was estimated to be 1.2-2.7 X 10(3) Pa.s (1.2-2.7 X 10(4)

	both reduced cytoplasmic activity and remanent-field decay, but affected

	this method calls for computational approaches to recover the quantities
	of interest; namely, the polymerization and depolymerization activities

	toward this goal have been hampered by the limited signal-to-noise
	ratio of typical FSM data, by the constant appearance and disappearance

	singularities characteristic of many cytoskeletal polymer assemblies.
	To deal with these problems, we present a particle-based method for

	treatment of anaphase cells with cytochalasin D induced a rapid,

	appear to be temporally activated at anaphase onset, and spatially
	modulated by the spindle interzone or separating chromosomes.},

	generate its unique architecture and function within cells. Here,
	we use quantitative fluorescence imaging techniques and ultrastructural
	analysis to address whether the Golgi apparatus is a steady-state
	or a stable organelle. We found that all classes of Golgi components
	are dynamically associated with this organelle, contrary to the prediction
	of the stable organelle model. Enzymes and recycling components are
	continuously exiting and reentering the Golgi apparatus by membrane
	trafficking pathways to and from the ER, whereas Golgi matrix proteins
	and coatomer undergo constant, rapid exchange between membrane and
	cytoplasm. When ER to Golgi transport is inhibited without disrupting
	COPII-dependent ER export machinery (by brefeldin A treatment or
	expression of Arf1[T31N]), the Golgi structure disassembles, leaving
	no residual Golgi membranes. Rather, all Golgi components redistribute
	into the ER, the cytoplasm, or to ER exit sites still active for
	recruitment of selective membrane-bound and peripherally associated
	cargos. A similar phenomenon is induced by the constitutively active
	Sar1[H79G] mutant, which has the additional effect of causing COPII-associated
	membranes to cluster to a juxtanuclear region. In cells expressing
	Sar1[T39N], a constitutively inactive form of Sar1 that completely
	disrupts ER exit sites, Golgi glycosylation enzymes, matrix, and
	itinerant proteins all redistribute to the ER. These results argue
	against the hypothesis that the Golgi apparatus contains stable components
	that can serve as a template for its biogenesis. Instead, they suggest
	that the Golgi complex is a dynamic, steady-state system, whose membranes
	can be nucleated and are maintained by the activities of the Sar1-COPII
	and Arf1-coatomer systems.},

	expansion at the cellular scale. Here, we present new software (RootflowRT)
	for measuring the expansion profile of a growing root at high spatial
	and temporal resolution. The software implements an image processing
	algorithm using a novel combination of optical flow methods for deformable
	motion. The algorithm operates on a stack of nine images with a given
	time interval between each (usually 10 s) and quantifies velocity
	confidently at most pixels of the image. The root does not need to
	be marked. The software calculates components of motion parallel
	and perpendicular to the local tangent of the root's midline. A variation
	of the software has been developed that reports the overall root
	growth rate versus time. Using this software, we find that the growth
	zone of the root can be divided into two distinct regions, an apical
	region where the rate of motion, i.e. velocity, rises gradually with
	position and a subapical region where velocity rises steeply with
	position. In both zones, velocity increases almost linearly with
	position, and the transition between zones is abrupt. We observed
	this pattern for roots of Arabidopsis, tomato (Lycopersicon lycopersicum),
	lettuce (Lactuca sativa), alyssum (Aurinia saxatilis), and timothy
	(Phleum pratense). These velocity profiles imply that relative elongation
	rate is regulated in a step-wise fashion, being low but roughly uniform
	within the meristem and then becoming high, but again roughly uniform,
	within the zone of elongation. The executable code for RootflowRT
	is available from the corresponding author on request.},

  abstract = {Invasive tumor dissemination in vitro and in vivo involves the proteolytic
	degradation of ECM barriers. This process, however, is only incompletely
	attenuated by protease inhibitor-based treatment, suggesting the
	existence of migratory compensation strategies. In three-dimensional
	collagen matrices, spindle-shaped proteolytically potent HT-1080
	fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells exhibited a constitutive
	mesenchymal-type movement including the coclustering of beta 1 integrins
	and MT1-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) at fiber bindings sites and
	the generation of tube-like proteolytic degradation tracks. Near-total
	inhibition of MMPs, serine proteases, cathepsins, and other proteases,
	however, induced a conversion toward spherical morphology at near
	undiminished migration rates. Sustained protease-independent migration
	resulted from a flexible amoeba-like shape change, i.e., propulsive
	squeezing through preexisting matrix gaps and formation of constriction
	rings in the absence of matrix degradation, concomitant loss of clustered
	beta 1 integrins and MT1-MMP from fiber binding sites, and a diffuse
	cortical distribution of the actin cytoskeleton. Acquisition of protease-independent
	amoeboid dissemination was confirmed for HT-1080 cells injected into
	the mouse dermis monitored by intravital multiphoton microscopy.
	In conclusion, the transition from proteolytic mesenchymal toward
	nonproteolytic amoeboid movement highlights a supramolecular plasticity
	mechanism in cell migration and further represents a putative escape
	mechanism in tumor cell dissemination after abrogation of pericellular
	proteolysis.},

	play an important functional role in biomembranes. Photobleaching
	studies have shown that many proteins in the plasma membrane have
	diffusion coefficients at least an order of magnitude lower than
	those obtained when the same proteins are reconstituted in artificial
	bilayer membranes. Depending on the protein, it has been shown that
	either the cytoplasmic domain or the ectodomain is the key determinant
	of its lateral mobility. Single particle tracking microscopy, which
	allows the motions of single or small groups of membrane molecules
	to be followed, promises not only to reveal new features of membrane
	dynamics, but also to help explain longstanding puzzles presented
	by the photobleaching studies, particularly the so-called immobile
	fraction. The combination of the two complementary technologies should
	measurably enhance our understanding of membrane microstructure.},

  abstract = {An early event of beta(2) integrin activation is the increased diffusion
	rate of this molecule on the cell surface, thereby providing integrin
	molecules with a better chance to meet the ligands. The activation
	of protein kinase C (PKC) stimulates integrin diffusion by releasing
	the cytoskeletal constraint on integrin molecules. We report here
	that macrophage-enriched myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate
	(MacMARCKS), a membrane-associated PKC substrate involved in integrin
	activation, is required for this PKC-stimulated diffusion of integrin
	molecules. Using the single-particle tracking technique, we observed
	that the activation of PKC stimulated an 11-fold increase in the
	diffusion rate of beta(2) integrins in wild type J774 macrophage
	cells but not in those expressing mutant MacMARCKS. Further evidence
	is provided from a MacMARCKS-deficient cell line in which phorbol
	esters failed to stimulate the diffusion of integrin. Transfection
	of wild type MacMARCKS into these cells restored the rapid diffusion
	rate of the beta(2) integrins. The phosphorylation of MacMARCKS is
	important because transfection of a nonphosphorylatable MacMARCKS
	mutant or the addition of staurosporine eliminates the rapid diffusion
	rate of integrin. Furthermore, adding cytochalasin D bypasses the
	MacMARCKS deficiency and stimulates beta(2) integrin diffusion, suggesting
	that MacMARCKS's involvement in integrin activation is prior or at
	the site of cytoskeleton. Therefore, we conclude that MacMARCKS is
	required for releasing the cytoskeletal constraint on integrin molecules
	during PKC-mediated integrin activation.},

  abstract = {Muscle contraction is usually measured and characterized with force
	and displacement transducers. The contraction of muscle fibers, however,
	evokes in the tissue a two and even three-dimensional displacement
	field, which is not properly quantified by these transducers because
	they provide just a single scalar quantity. This problem can be circumvented
	by using optical measurements and standard tools of computer vision,
	developed for the analysis of time varying image sequences. By computing
	the so called optical flow, i.e. the apparent motion of points in
	a time varying image sequence, it is possible to recover a two-dimensional
	motion field, describing rather precisely the displacement caused
	by muscle contraction in a flattened piece of skin. The obtained
	two-dimensional optical flow can be further analyzed by computing
	its elementary deformation components, providing a novel and accurate
	characterization of the contraction induced by different motoneurons.
	This technique is demonstrated analyzing the displacement caused
	by muscle contraction in the skin of the leech, Hirudo medicinalis.
	The proposed technique can be applied to monitor and characterize
	all contractions in almost flat tissues with enough visual texture.},

	investigate neural coding of sensorimotor responses because it allows
	both observation of behavior and the simultaneous measurement of
	a large fraction of its underlying neuronal activity. In this study,
	we used a combination of multielectrode recordings, videomicroscopy,
	and computation of the optical flow to investigate the reproducibility
	of the motor response caused by local mechanical stimulation of the
	leech skin. We analyzed variability at different levels of processing:
	mechanosensory neurons, motoneurons, muscle activation, and behavior.
	Spike trains in mechanosensory neurons were very reproducible, unlike
	those in motoneurons. The motor response, however, was reproducible
	because of two distinct biophysical mechanisms. First, leech muscles
	contract slowly and therefore are poorly sensitive to the jitter
	of motoneuron spikes. Second, the motor response results from the
	coactivation of a population of motoneurons firing in a statistically
	independent way, which reduces the variability of the population
	firing. These data show that reproducible spike trains are not required
	to sustain reproducible behaviors and illustrate how the nervous
	system can cope with unreliable components to produce reliable action.},

  abstract = {Activation of motoneurons innervating leech muscles causes the appearance
	of a two-dimensional vector field of deformations on the skin surface
	that can be fully characterized using a new technique (Zoccolan et
	al., 2001) based on the computation of the optical flow, the two-dimensional
	vector field describing the point displacements on the skin. These
	vector fields are characterized by their origin (i.e., the singular
	point) and by four elementary components that combine linearly: expansion
	(or compression), rotation, longitudinal shear, and oblique shear.
	All motoneurons can be classified and recognized according to the
	components of the deformations they elicit: longitudinal motoneurons
	give rise almost exclusively to longitudinal negative shear, whereas
	circular motoneurons give rise to both positive longitudinal shear
	and significant negative expansion. Oblique motoneurons induce strong
	oblique shear, in addition to longitudinal shear and negative expansion.
	Vector fields induced by the contraction of longitudinal, circular,
	and oblique fibers superimpose linearly. Skin deformations can therefore
	be attributed rather reliably to the contraction of distinct longitudinal,
	circular, and oblique muscle fibers. We compared the deformation
	patterns produced by touching the skin with those produced by intracellular
	stimulation of P, T, and N cells: vector fields resulting from the
	activation of P cells were almost identical to those produced by
	mechanical stimulation. Therefore, motor responses triggered by light
	or moderate touch are almost entirely mediated by excitation of P
	cells, with minor contributions from T and N cells.},
